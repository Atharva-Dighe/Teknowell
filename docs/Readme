This is my first project where I tried to build a copy of Royal Enfield Bikes website referring 
thier original website using HTML and CSS only.
Features of website are Fully Responsiveness, hover effects applied to various elements at different places.
As you can see, I have tried to maintain proper folder structure during development of the entire project.
External CSS has been used for styling the web pages using element as well as class selectors inside it.

Coming to the detailed explanation part of project, the Navbar consists of two div elements (Logo & Menu buttons)
having display:flex property applied. 
The footer having seven div elements also has same CSS properties used.
Both of them have hover effect where text color as well as cursor type gets changed.
Again the different pages of website are connected to each other using anchor tag to the menu buttons of navbar section.
Also the social media icons of footer section are also connected using anchor tag.

Moving to the Motorcycles page, I have made cards using div elements for displaying different Bikes, its photo 
and some short description. The cards have hover effect of shadow to it's right and bottom side. 
They also have been linked to the bike description to original RE website using anchor tag.

Inside the Contact page, I have designed a form inside the contact us page collecting user information 
like name, mobile no., email and querry which gets opened as the user clicks on the "Contact Us" button present on the page.

I have tried my best to maintain aesthetics and keep the website simple and user friendly.
All the pages have become responsive by the use of div elements everywhere having "display:flex" "flex-wrap:wrap" 
property making them easy to access on any screen size.
